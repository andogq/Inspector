# Inspector

A web app for tracking ticket inspectors.

This is a passion project to help expand my skills accross a number of technologies and to make a full blown app.

It runs on the Google Cloud Plateform and utlises NodeJS with Firestore, and HTML/CSS and JS on the client side, which will eventually be a Progressive Web App.
